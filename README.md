Your DevOps Dumpster Fire (a.k.a. README.md)

Welcome to my trash heap of a repo, where I’m trying to claw my way from Linux dork to DevOps demigod. 
It’s less “structured roadmap” and more “guy yelling at clouds until they work.” Expect chaos, caffeine stains, and maybe some actual learning if we’re lucky.

🚀 What’s This Chaos About?

I’m on a mission to master DevOps—think AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and all the buzzwords that sound cool at job interviews. This repo is my proof I haven’t given up (yet). Inside, you’ll find:

    Projects that might set your CPU on fire.
    Notes that sound like I’m arguing with my past self.
    Meltdowns about IAM roles at 2 a.m.

It’s less “step-by-step guide” and more “survival log of a caffeine-fueled madman.” 

##Inspired by the DevOps Roadmap, but with way more swearing.

📂 How It’s (Barely) Organized

    scripts/ 🧠: My attempts at thriving Proxmox, Terraform, AWS, Docker, and CI/CD. Spoiler: I’m still confused.
    projects/ 🛠️: Hands-on chaos like a Proxmox home lab or an AWS app that might work.
    certifications/ 📜: Notes for exams like AWS Certified DevOps Engineer. Send help.

🤝 We’re in This Mess Together

    Checklists ✅: Tick ‘em off and feel like a champ.
    Overwhelmed? Step away. This repo won’t judge you.
    Laugh It Off: My screw-ups are here for your entertainment.

DevOps feels like juggling flaming torches on a unicycle—scary, but doable. If I can stumble through this without yeeting my laptop out a window, so can you. Wanna scream about Docker or swap war stories? Hit me up at https://github.com/flongstaff!
